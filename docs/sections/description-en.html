<span class="markdown">The Workplace Management of the University of Torino Ontology (WMTO) is a multi-domain ontological framework that integrates organizational, spatial, and asset-related knowledge for workplace management. The ontology selectively imports classes, properties, and axioms from six established vocabularies rather than incorporating them entirely: BOT for building topology and spatial hierarchies, REC for real estate and furniture assets, Brick for ICT equipment, ORG for organizational structure, FOAF for employee personal details, and Schema.org for events and cross-domain properties. WMTO is structured around three operational domainsâ€”Human Resources (HR) for employee information and organizational membership, Facilities Management (FM) for spatial topology and furniture inventory, and ICT management for equipment tracking and user allocation. This modular approach enables unified semantic representation across traditionally siloed organizational functions, facilitating integrated queries spanning multiple organizational domains.</span>
