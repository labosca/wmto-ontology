<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Workplace Management of the University of Torino Ontology (WMTO) is a modular OWL ontology designed to provide semantic interoperability for workplace management practices in enterprise environments. 
By integrating concepts from established ontologies including BOT, REC, Brick, ORG, FOAF, and Schema.org, WMTO offers a comprehensive framework for representing organizational structure, spatial topology, physical asset management, and employee allocation.
The ontology addresses the semantic heterogeneity challenges that arise when integrating data from multiple workplace management domains (Human Resources, Facility Management, and Information and Communication Technology) into unified Digital Twin Environments.
Following the diagram-first modelling paradigm and emphasizing modularity, WMTO balances the reuse of well-established ontological patterns with the introduction of enterprise-specific concepts tailored to workplace management needs.
The ontology supports advanced use cases including historical asset allocation tracking, space optimization planning, remote work management, and cross-domain data integration, while maintaining extensibility through its modular architecture that localizes changes and facilitates future adaptations.
