Modern workplace management involves the coordination of multiple organizational functions, each maintaining separate data systems with distinct vocabularies, structures, and semantics. Human Resources departments manage employee information and organizational hierarchies; Facility Management teams oversee spatial allocation and furniture assets; Information and Communication Technology units track equipment and digital resources. This fragmentation creates significant challenges for data integration, analytics, and decision-making processes that require cross-domain insights.
The development of digital twin environments for workplace management necessitates a unified semantic layer capable of bridging these heterogeneous data sources. The Workplace Management of the University of Torino Ontology (WMTO) addresses this need by providing formally defined concepts and relationships that enable semantic interoperability while respecting the domain-specific requirements of each workplace management function.
WMTO is designed to support the following core objectives:
- Semantic Integration: Provide a common vocabulary for integrating workplace management data across HR, FM, and ICT domains
- Historical Tracking: Enable temporal representation of asset allocations, spatial assignments, and organizational changes
- Spatial Representation: Model building topology and workplace allocation with sufficient granularity for space optimization
- Asset Management: Support lifecycle tracking of both ICT equipment and furniture assets from commissioning to turnover
- Organizational Modeling: Represent complex organizational structures, employment relationships, and role distinctions
- Extensibility: Facilitate future adaptations through modular design and case-study-specific enumeration patterns

WMTO introduces several distinctive modeling patterns that enhance its utility for workplace management:
- Allocation Pattern: Rather than embedding allocation attributes directly in asset or space classes, WMTO creates intermediate allocation nodes (e.g., wmto:AssetAllocation, wmto:WorkplaceAllocation) that carry temporal constraints. This pattern enables multiple allocation records over time without overwriting existing properties, supporting comprehensive historical analysis
- Enumeration Strategy: Case-study-specific classifications (organizational unit types, employment types, role types, asset types) are managed through enumeration lists, allowing organizations to customize taxonomies while maintaining ontological structure
- Remote Work Semantics: The ontology introduces properties for tracking remote work patterns (wmto:remoteWorkDaysN), positioning workplace management systems to support hybrid work policies and space optimization strategies
- Modular Replacement: The clear delineation of modules enables organizations to replace or extend specific domain areas without affecting the entire ontology, supporting evolutionary development
